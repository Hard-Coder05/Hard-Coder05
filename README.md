# Hey Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I am a tech enthusiast interested in Development of Mobile Apps using Flutter and JAVA.

I am an avid learner who is enthusiastic about learning something new each and every day. On the whole, I love to code and am an enthusiastic coder.

I am skilled in C++, Flutter, Dart, JAVA, Python, HTML, CSS and PHP. I am also a competitive programmer. Looking forward to exploring Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in near future to quench my interests in Mathematics!

When I am not coding, I love playing some games, listening to songs or simply sitting somewhere in the lap of nature doing nothing or embracing it.
